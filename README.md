# spring-boot-ltw
# Example of AspectJ load-time weaving in a Spring Boot application.
This project contains a solution to a problem that occurs when you inject a service into an Aspect and it just throws a NPE. Spring documentation doesn't cover that, so I hope this hello-world project will come useful to someone.

Run the app by using
./gradlew bootRun
in the terminal.
